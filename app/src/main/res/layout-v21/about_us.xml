Falling asleep in the safety of mother&apos;s lap. And heartbreak? Your friend getting the Pokemon collector deck before you did.\n\nIf there is any place untainted and unscarred by the sometimes shape edges of adolescence, it&apos;s childhood: akin to a warm afternoon when the world was exactly as it was supposed to be and all the happiness ever was right within one&apos;s reach. No matter what decade you are traveling in, the taste of childhood lingers on one&apos;s tongue like Heaven&apos;s unforgettable elixir.\n\nTo capture again this very essence of childhood that still tugs at out heartstrings, Apratim &apos;16 is back this year with the theme &apos;Relive your Childhood&apos;. Come join us as we walk down those lanes again and splash around in those (very muddy?) memories.\n\nIts time to reunite with our inner child again!"
